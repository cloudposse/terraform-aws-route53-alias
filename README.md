# terraform-aws-route53-alias [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-alias.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-alias) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-alias.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-alias/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module that implements "vanity" host names (e.g. `brand.com`) as `ALIAS` records to another Route53 DNS resource record (e.g. ELB/ALB, S3 Bucket Endpoint or CloudFront Distribution).
Unlike `CNAME` records, the synthetic `ALIAS` record works with zone apexes.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

This will define a `A` resource record for `www.example.com` as an alias of the `aws_elb.example.dns_name`.

```terraform
module "production_www" {
  source          = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-alias.git?ref=master"
  aliases         = ["www.example.com.", "static1.cdn.example.com.", "static2.cdn.example.com"]
  parent_zone_id  = "${var.parent_zone_id}"
  target_dns_name = "${aws_elb.example.dns_name}"
  target_zone_id  = "${aws_elb.example.zone_id}"
}
```






## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                This help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  lint                                Lint terraform code

```
